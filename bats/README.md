This binary is a minimized BATS protocol with the following limitations added:

- limited maximum input rate at 100Mbps.
- limited maximum running time at 80 seconds.
- limited feature set.
- required a software license to run.

If you want to run the test on your local machine, please contact [peng.lei@n-hop.com](peng.lei@n-hop.com) to obtain a free license key.

## About BATS Protocol

The BATS Protocol is a distributed network protocol developed based on the idea of network coding. It uses a novel coding scheme to achieve high throughput and low latency. The protocol software is implemented using modern C++ with dependencies on the standard C++ library and the Unix socket API. It provides basic functionality for the L3, L4, and L5 layers of the OSI seven-layer model. The BATS Protocol supports multi-hop, multi-path, and multicast transmission modes. It also features a revolutionary congestion control algorithm optimized with network coding technology. Additionally, it has a dynamic adaptive coding rate based on packet loss detection. Compared to traditional protocols like TCP and UDP, as well as commonly used FEC transmission protocols like KCP, the BATS Protocol is more efficient and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.
